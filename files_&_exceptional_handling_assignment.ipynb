        "Ans. The primary difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how the code is executed by the computer:\n",
        "\n",
        "###1. Compiled Languages:\n",
        "(a) Compilation Process:\n",
        "\n",
        "* In compiled languages, the source code is translated into machine code (binary code) by a compiler before it is executed. This translation process happens once, and the output is a standalone executable file.\n",
        "\n",
        "(b) Execution:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Once compiled, the program can be run directly on any compatible system without needing the source code or a compiler.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go.\n",
        "\n",
        "(c) Advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Performance: Compiled code is typically faster because it is directly converted into machine code that the computer can execute.\n",
        "- Optimization: The compiler can optimize the code for performance during the compilation process.\n",
        "\n",
        "(d) Disadvantages:\n",
        "* Longer Development Time: Since the code must be compiled each time it is changed, development cycles may be slower.\n",
        "* Platform Dependency: Compiled programs are usually platform-specific and require recompilation for different operating systems or hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2. Interpreted Languages:\n",
        "(a) Interpretation Process: In interpreted languages, the source code is not translated directly into machine code. Instead, an interpreter reads and executes the code line by line at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "(b) Execution: There is no separate compilation step; the interpreter processes the code on-the-fly, which can lead to slower execution compared to compiled languages.\n",

        "\n",
        "(d) Disadvantages:\n",
        "* Slower Performance: Interpreted code is generally slower than compiled code because it requires translation at runtime.\n",

It is a critical part of debugging and monitoring, especially in large or complex programs. Python provides a built-in module called logging to handle logging with various levels of severity and output destinations (like console, files, or remote servers).\n",
        "\n",
        "*Key Concepts in Python Logging:*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Logging Levels: These represent the severity of the messages that are logged. The common levels are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* DEBUG: Detailed information, typically useful for diagnosing problems.\n",
        "* INFO: General information about the application's operation (normal functioning).\n",

        "* ERROR: More serious problems that indicate a failure in part of the application.\n",
        "* CRITICAL: Very serious errors that may cause the application to stop or fail entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Loggers: Loggers are objects that you use to write log messages. You can create a logger with the logging.getLogger(name) method. By default, if you don’t provide a name, it will return the root logger.\n",

        "Ans. The __del__ method in Python is significant because it serves as a destructor, allowing you to define custom behavior for cleaning up an object when it is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key points that highlight its significance:\n",

        "2. Resource Management: It's particularly useful for managing external resources, like database connections, network connections, or file handles, that need to be explicitly closed before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Custom Destruction Behavior: The method allows customization of the object destruction process, making it possible to handle specific resource management needs as the object goes out of scope or is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Important for Memory Management: Although Python uses automatic garbage collection, __del__ provides an opportunity to ensure that resources tied to an object are properly released, reducing the risk of resource leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, its significance also comes with limitations. For example, it may not always be called in cases of circular references, and its behavior can be unpredictable due to the non-deterministic nature of garbage collection. Therefore, in many cases, more controlled alternatives, such as context managers (using with statements), are preferred for resource management.\n",

The with statement in Python is used to handle files (and other resources) in a way that ensures proper acquisition and release of resources, such as closing a file after it is no longer needed. It is a context manager that automatically takes care of opening and closing a file, even if an exception occurs during the file operations. This eliminates the need to manually call file.close() and helps prevent resource leaks or errors.\n",

        "###Q9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "Ans. The terms multithreading and multiprocessing both refer to ways of achieving concurrency (the ability to run multiple tasks at the same time) in computing, but they differ in how they execute and manage tasks. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Basic Concept\n",
        "\n",
        "* Multithreading: it involves a single process that creates multiple threads within itself. Each thread runs a part of the task concurrently, but they all share the same memory space and resources.\n",
        "* Multiprocessing: it involves creating multiple processes, each with its own memory space. Each process runs independently and can operate on different tasks simultaneously.\n",
        "2. Resource Sharing\n",
        "\n",
        "* Multithreading: Threads within the same process share the same memory space and resources (such as variables and file handles), which can lead to faster communication between threads but also to potential issues with data corruption if not handled carefully (e.g., race conditions).\n",
        "* Multiprocessing: Each process has its own separate memory space. This means processes do not share memory directly, reducing the risk of data corruption but also making inter-process communication more complex and slower compared to threads.\n",
        "3. Use of CPU Cores\n",
        "\n",
        "* Multithreading: Multiple threads within a process can be scheduled to run on different cores, but because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in some languages (like Python), threads might not achieve true parallel execution. In such cases, threads are primarily used to handle I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading/writing files, network operations).\n",
        "* Multiprocessing: Each process runs independently, and multiple processes can run on different CPU cores, achieving true parallelism. This is ideal for CPU-bound tasks, where each process performs intensive computation that benefits from parallel execution.\n",
        "4. Overhead\n",
        "* Multithreading: Generally has lower overhead compared to multiprocessing because threads are lightweight and share the same resources (memory space), which makes thread creation and switching faster.\n",
        "* Multiprocessing: Has more overhead because processes are heavier and require more resources (e.g., separate memory space), which means process creation and context switching take more time.\n",
        "5. Communication\n",
        "*  Multithreading: Since threads share the same memory space, communication between threads is easier and faster, typically using shared variables or data structures. However, careful synchronization (e.g., locks) is necessary to avoid conflicts.\n",
        "*  Multiprocessing: Communication between processes is more complicated and generally done using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory, which can be slower compared to thread-based communication.\n",
        "6. Fault Tolerance\n",
        "* Multithreading: If one thread crashes, it can potentially affect all the other threads within the same process, since they share the same memory space.\n",
        "* Multiprocessing: If one process crashes, it does not affect other processes, making multiprocessing more robust and fault-tolerant for certain types of applications.\n",
        "7. Typical Use Cases\n",
        "* Multithreading:\n",
        "Ideal for I/O-bound tasks where the program spends a lot of time waiting (e.g., network requests, file operations).\n",
        "Used in scenarios where fast task switching is needed, such as user interfaces.\n",
        "* Multiprocessing:\n",
        "Ideal for CPU-bound tasks where intensive computation benefits from running in parallel (e.g., data processing, machine learning, scientific computing).\n",

        "Distributed Systems: In distributed or microservices architectures, logging can help track events across multiple components. Logs can be aggregated in a central logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) for easier monitoring and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error Correlation: With proper logging strategies, you can correlate logs from different components of a system and understand the flow of data or errors across services.\n",
        "8. Customizable\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexible Configuration: Logging frameworks often allow you to customize log formats, destinations (file, console, remote server), and levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR). This makes it adaptable to different needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "External Integration: Logs can be integrated with other tools and systems like alerting mechanisms or monitoring dashboards, enabling proactive responses to issues.\n",

        "###Q11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "Ans. Memory management in Python refers to the process of efficiently allocating, tracking, and freeing memory during the execution of a Python program. Python manages memory automatically through several techniques to ensure optimal performance while simplifying programming tasks for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Key Concepts in Python Memory Management***\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Memory Allocation:\n",
        "\n",
        "* When Python creates objects (like numbers, lists, dictionaries, etc.), it allocates memory dynamically. The memory is allocated from a pool called the heap. For small objects, Python may use a memory pool (e.g., for integers, small strings) to reduce memory fragmentation.\n",
        "2. Reference Counting:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python uses reference counting to manage the lifetime of objects. Each object in Python maintains a counter (a reference count) that tracks how many references exist to that object. When the reference count drops to zero (meaning no references to the object remain), the object is deallocated.\n",
        "* For example, if you create a list a = [1, 2, 3], the reference count for the list is 1. If you assign b = a, the reference count increases to 2 because a and b both reference the list.\n",
        "3. Garbage Collection:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Circular references: While reference counting works well for most cases, it can't handle circular references (when two or more objects reference each other in a loop). To address this, Python includes a garbage collector that periodically checks for objects that are no longer in use but are still being referenced due to circular references.\n",
        "* The garbage collector uses an algorithm that divides objects into generations (young, middle-aged, and old) and performs garbage collection based on their age and survival rate across multiple collection cycles. This helps improve performance by not collecting objects too often.\n",
        "* The gc module provides control over this process, allowing developers to force garbage collection or configure thresholds.\n",
        "4. Memory Pools (Private Heap):\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python uses a private heap to store objects, which is managed by the Python memory manager. This private heap is where all Python objects and data structures are allocated.\n",
        "* To minimize the overhead of allocating and deallocating memory, Python maintains different memory pools for objects of different sizes. The pymalloc allocator manages this private heap, making memory management faster and more efficient.\n",
        "5. Memory Optimization Techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Object Reuse: Small, commonly used objects (like integers and short strings) are reused in Python through an internal cache mechanism. This reduces memory overhead by avoiding creating multiple copies of identical objects.\n",
        "* Memory Views: Python offers memoryview objects that allow for memory-efficient handling of large data sets (like NumPy arrays) by referencing the same memory without creating copies.\n",
        "6. Dynamic Typing:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python is dynamically typed, meaning that variables don't have fixed types, and their memory usage can change during runtime. This dynamic nature adds complexity to memory management, but the automatic garbage collection and reference counting help mitigate issues.\n",
        "7. Manual Memory Management:\n",
        "\n",
        "* While Python handles memory management automatically, developers can influence memory usage by managing object references carefully, using generators to avoid loading large datasets into memory at once, and employing the del statement to remove references to objects.\n",
        "***Key Tools for Memory Management***\n",
        "* gc Module: The garbage collector module allows you to interact with Python’s garbage collection process. For example, gc.collect() forces garbage collection, and gc.get_count() gives the current count of objects in each generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Memory Profiling: Python also provides tools like sys.getsizeof() to check the memory size of an object. Third-party libraries like pympler or memory_profiler help developers track memory usage over time.\n",

        "Ans. Memory management is a crucial aspect of programming in any language, including Python, for several key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Efficient Resource Utilization\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python, like other programming languages, runs on systems with limited memory resources. Efficient memory management ensures that memory is used effectively and avoids unnecessary wastage.\n",
        "- Without proper memory management, programs may consume excessive memory, leading to slower performance or even crashes, especially in systems with limited resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python uses an automatic memory management system with a built-in garbage collector, which automatically tracks and frees memory that is no longer in use. This reduces the burden on developers to manually manage memory (as is required in languages like C or C++).\n",
        "- The garbage collector frees memory used by objects that are no longer reachable or referenced in the program, preventing memory leaks (unused memory that is not released).\n",
        "3. Avoiding Memory Leaks\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory leaks occur when a program continues to hold references to objects that are no longer needed, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming memory.\n",
        "- Without good memory management, memory leaks can accumulate over time, slowing down the program and eventually exhausting system resources, leading to performance degradation or application crashes.\n",
        "4. Optimizing Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory management affects performance. If memory is not freed or managed properly, programs can slow down due to increased demand for memory (e.g., swapping data in and out of disk storage).\n",
        "- For programs handling large amounts of data, memory management strategies like object reuse, memory pools, or weak references can significantly improve efficiency.\n",
        "5. Managing Large Data Structures\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python programs often deal with complex and large data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, arrays). If these structures are not managed well, they can take up large amounts of memory, slowing down or halting a program.\n",
        "- Memory management allows developers to design algorithms and data structures that minimize memory usage while still performing optimally.\n",
        "6. Preventing Fragmentation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory fragmentation occurs when free memory is split into small, non-contiguous blocks over time. This can reduce the system's ability to allocate large chunks of memory efficiently, even if enough total memory is available.\n",
        "- Python’s memory manager attempts to minimize fragmentation by using techniques like object pooling and heap management, making sure memory is allocated in contiguous blocks.\n",
        "7. Improved Scalability\n",
        "\n",
        "- Proper memory management ensures that Python applications can scale efficiently to handle increasing amounts of data or users without running into memory-related bottlenecks.\n",
        "- This is especially critical for applications running in resource-constrained environments, such as embedded systems or cloud-based systems with strict resource limits.\n",

        "Ans. In Python, the try and except blocks are used for exception handling to manage errors that occur during the execution of a program. The role of try and except is to allow a program to continue running even if an error occurs, by catching the error (exception) and handling it in a controlled way.\n",

        "###Q15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "Ans Python's garbage collection system is designed to automatically manage memory and clean up objects that are no longer in use, preventing memory leaks and optimizing the use of system resources. Python uses a combination of reference counting and cycle detection to manage garbage collection. Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Reference Counting\n",
        "\n",
        "Python keeps track of how many references (variables or objects) point to an object in memory. Each object in Python has an associated reference count. When the reference count of an object drops to zero, meaning no part of the program is using it, the object can be safely deallocated. This is the basic mechanism for memory management in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points about Reference Counting:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Every time a new reference to an object is created (e.g., by assigning the object to a new variable), the reference count is incremented.\n",
        "- When a reference goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted (e.g., del), the reference count is decremented.\n",
        "When the reference count of an object reaches zero, Python deallocates the object, freeing the memory.\n",
        "      2. Cycle Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "In certain situations, objects can reference each other in a cycle, making them impossible to clean up with reference counting alone. For example, two objects may refer to each other, and even though there are no external references to them, their reference counts will never drop to zero. This creates a memory leak.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this, Python has a cycle detector that runs periodically to look for such cyclic references. The cycle detector is part of Python's garbage collector (GC).\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Garbage Collection Process:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python's garbage collection system runs in the background and looks for reference cycles.\n",
        "- It uses a generational garbage collection algorithm to optimize the process. The idea behind this is that objects that have been around for a while are less likely to be garbage, so they are collected less frequently than newer objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "      3. Generational Garbage Collection\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's garbage collector divides objects into three generations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generation 0 (Young generation): Newer objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generation 1 (Middle generation): Objects that have survived one garbage collection cycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generation 2 (Old generation): Objects that have survived multiple garbage collection cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The garbage collection process proceeds as follows:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Young objects (in Generation 0) are collected most frequently, because they are the most likely to become unreachable quickly.\n",
        "- Objects that survive in Generation 0 are promoted to Generation 1, and objects that survive Generation 1 are promoted to Generation 2.\n",
        "- The garbage collector checks for cycles more thoroughly in Generation 2 because these objects are the longest-lived.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points about Generational Collection:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Minor GC: This occurs when only Generation 0 is collected. It happens frequently and is relatively inexpensive.\n",
        "- Major GC: This occurs when all generations are collected (a \"full\" garbage collection). This happens less frequently but is more expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "      4. Manual Control and Configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides the gc module for manual control over garbage collection. Some of the functions available in the gc module are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- gc.collect(): Explicitly runs the garbage collection process.\n",
        "- gc.get_count(): Returns the current collection counts for each generation.\n",
        "- gc.set_threshold(): Configures when to trigger garbage collection for each generation.\n",

It provides a way to separate the \"normal\" code that should execute when everything goes as expected from the \"error handling\" code that should execute when an exception is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of the else block:\n",

        "###Q19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "Ans. Closing a file in Python is crucial for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Releasing System Resources: When you open a file, the operating system allocates resources (like memory and file handles) for the file operation. If you don't close the file, these resources might not be released, which can lead to memory leaks or exhaustion of available file handles. This can result in performance issues or even cause the system to be unable to open new files.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Ensuring Data is Written Properly: In Python, when writing to a file, the data may not be immediately written to disk. Instead, it might be buffered in memory to optimize performance. Closing the file ensures that all buffered data is flushed to the file. If you don't close the file properly, some of the data may not be written, leading to incomplete or corrupted files.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Avoiding File Locks: Some operating systems use file locks to prevent multiple processes from accessing the same file simultaneously. If you leave a file open, it may remain locked, which could prevent other programs or even other parts of your own program from accessing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Good Programming Practice: Closing files explicitly is a good practice that helps prevent errors and makes your code more reliable. It ensures that file operations are completed properly, without leaving resources hanging.\n",

        "###Q23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "Ans. Memory management in Python involves several challenges that developers must navigate to optimize performance and resource usage. These challenges arise due to the nature of Python's memory model, its dynamic typing, and its automatic memory management system (which includes garbage collection).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some of the primary challenges associated with memory management in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)\n",
        "\n",
        "-Reference Counting: Python uses reference counting as the primary technique for memory management, which means it keeps track of how many references there are to an object in memory. When an object’s reference count drops to zero, it is deallocated. However, this can cause circular references (where objects refer to each other), preventing the reference count from dropping to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Circular References: Circular references occur when two or more objects reference each other, causing their reference counts to never reach zero. Python’s garbage collector can detect and clean up circular references, but the process is not perfect and can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- GC Overhead: The garbage collector periodically checks for objects with no references. However, this can introduce performance overhead, particularly in long-running applications or those with large numbers of objects. The timing of garbage collection is not always predictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Dynamic Typing and Object Overhead\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dynamic Typing: In Python, types are dynamically assigned, and this can lead to additional memory usage compared to statically typed languages. Each Python object carries additional metadata (such as type information), which increases the overall memory footprint of objects.\n",
        "- Object Metadata: Every object in Python has some associated overhead, such as a reference count, type information, and other metadata. This overhead increases the memory usage of Python programs, especially when dealing with small objects or large collections of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Memory Fragmentation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Fragmentation: Memory fragmentation occurs when memory is allocated and deallocated in small, scattered chunks. Over time, this can result in inefficient use of memory. In Python, fragmentation can happen because the memory allocator works in blocks, and when objects are created and deleted, these blocks may become fragmented.\n",
        "- Heap Management: Python uses a private heap for memory management. This heap is divided into blocks, and objects are allocated within these blocks. Fragmentation in this heap can occur when objects are created and deleted in an unpredictable pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Large Data Structures and High Memory Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory Consumption of Data Structures: Some data structures in Python (like lists, dictionaries, and sets) can consume significant memory, especially when they grow large. Lists, for example, tend to over-allocate space to avoid frequent resizing. This can lead to higher memory consumption than expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inefficient Use of Memory for Large Objects: Certain types of objects, such as large arrays or complex data structures, can use significant amounts of memory. This can lead to inefficient memory management when large objects are not reused or properly deallocated.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Memory Leaks\n",
        "\n",
        "- Unintentional Retention of References: Memory leaks in Python can occur if objects are unintentionally retained in memory, preventing their proper garbage collection. This can happen if references to objects are kept alive longer than needed (e.g., through global variables or closures that keep references to large objects).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Third-Party Libraries: Memory leaks can also be introduced by third-party libraries. Some libraries may not properly manage memory, leading to leaks that may be hard to detect and fix.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and Memory Management\n",
        "\n",
        "- GIL's Impact on Memory Management: The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python affects how multi-threaded programs interact with memory. Since the GIL prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously, it can create performance bottlenecks. This also affects memory management, especially when memory needs to be shared or modified across threads.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Manual Memory Management and Optimizations\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory Profiling and Optimization: Python offers tools like gc (for garbage collection) and sys.getsizeof() (to check object sizes), but optimizing memory usage still requires significant effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Developers must profile their applications, identify areas where memory usage can be optimized (such as using more memory-efficient data structures or avoiding unnecessary copies of objects), and manage memory manually when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory Pools and Custom Allocators: Python’s memory allocator can sometimes benefit from custom memory pools or allocators, but configuring and managing this can be complex and error-prone.\n",

For example, PyPy has a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler that may improve performance but complicates memory management. Similarly, Jython and IronPython handle memory differently due to their reliance on Java and .NET environments, respectively.\n",

        "###Q25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "Ans. Multithreading is important in certain applications because it enables efficient use of system resources, particularly in scenarios where multiple tasks need to be executed simultaneously or in parallel. Here are some key reasons why multithreading is valuable:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Improved Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Concurrency: Multithreading allows an application to perform multiple operations concurrently, which is especially beneficial on multi-core processors. Each thread can run on a separate core, enabling better utilization of the hardware and faster execution.\n",
        "- Better CPU Utilization: By allowing different threads to run in parallel, the system can make more effective use of the CPU. Without multithreading, some CPU cores may be idle while others are overburdened.\n",
        "2. Responsiveness:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Non-blocking Operations: In applications with user interfaces (e.g., games or GUI applications), multithreading allows long-running tasks (like file loading or network communication) to run in the background without freezing or making the interface unresponsive. This improves user experience.\n",
        "- Real-time Processing: For applications like real-time systems, multithreading helps in managing time-sensitive tasks concurrently without missing deadlines.\n",
        "3. Resource Management:\n",
        "\n",
        "- I/O-bound Applications: For tasks involving a lot of waiting, like file I/O or network requests, multithreading allows one thread to handle the I/O while other threads perform useful work. This avoids wasting CPU cycles waiting for I/O to complete.\n",
        "- Parallelism: In data-heavy applications (e.g., scientific simulations or large-scale data processing), multithreading can split tasks into smaller parts, allowing them to be processed in parallel. This reduces the total time required for computation.\n",
        "4. Scalability:\n",
        "\n",
        "- As modern processors come with more cores, multithreading enables applications to scale efficiently and handle larger workloads without a significant loss in performance. It ensures that the application can grow with advances in hardware.\n",
        "5. Improved System Responsiveness Under Load:\n",
        "\n",
        "- In server-side applications (like web servers or database systems), multithreading helps handle multiple requests simultaneously. This makes the system more scalable and responsive under heavy loads.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Examples of Multithreading Use Cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Web Servers: Handle multiple client requests concurrently, improving throughput and reducing latency.\n",
        "- Games and Simulations: Use separate threads for graphics rendering, physics calculations, user input handling, etc.\n",
        "- Data Processing: In applications that process large datasets (e.g., video encoding, scientific computing), tasks can be parallelized to speed up processing time.\n",
        "- Real-time Systems: Manage multiple tasks, such as monitoring sensors, processing inputs, and making real-time decisions, simultaneously.\n",
