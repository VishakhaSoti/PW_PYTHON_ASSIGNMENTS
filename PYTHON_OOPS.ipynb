        "###Q1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Ans. The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It also involves restricting access to certain components of an object to protect the internal state of the object. This is achieved through access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows a programmer to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction is often implemented through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance:\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. A subclass can also override methods from the superclass or add new methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism:\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The most common type of polymorphism is method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. It can also refer to method overloading, where multiple methods with the same name but different parameters can exist in the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Association:\n",
        "Association refers to the relationship between two or more objects. It defines how objects are related to one another. There are various types of associations, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. This concept enables objects to interact with each other and share functionality, forming complex systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts together enable the creation of more modular, reusable, and maintainable code in OOP.\n",

In Python, method overloading (where you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or numbers) is not natively supported in the same way as in some other languages like Java or C++. In Python, the last defined method with a particular name will override any previous methods with the same name.\n",

        "Ans. The Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a class hierarchy. This is particularly important in the context of inheritance, where a class may inherit from one or more classes (in single or multiple inheritance). When a method is called on an object, Python needs to determine the sequence of classes it will search to find that method or attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the MRO follows the C3 linearization algorithm, which ensures a consistent and predictable order in method resolution. This is important in multiple inheritance scenarios to avoid ambiguity and to define a clear order in which base classes are considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "* How MRO works:\n",
        "\n",
        "In single inheritance, MRO is straightforward: Python will search the class itself first, then its base class, and so on up the class hierarchy.\n",
        "In multiple inheritance, Python needs to resolve the method calls by a specific order, which is determined by the C3 linearization algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "* C3 Linearization:\n",
        "\n",
        "C3 linearization, also known as the C3 superclass linearization, is an algorithm that provides a consistent method for determining the order in which classes are searched. It considers:\n",
        "\n",
        "The class itself.\n",
        "Its base classes, with some constraints to avoid conflicts.\n",
        "The method resolution order ensures that classes are checked in a way that maintains both depth and breadth in the class hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Retrieving MRO Programmatically:\n",
        "\n",
        "We can retrieve the MRO of a class using the built-in method mro(), which is available for all Python classes. The MRO is returned as a list of classes, ordered from the current class to the topmost base class (object)."

        "1. __str__ method:\n",
        "\n",
        "The __str__ method is used to define how an object is represented as a string when you call str() on the object or when you print the object using print().\n",
        "In this case, the __str__ method returns a string that includes the value of the object, e.g., \"CustomClass with value: 10\".\n",
        "Usage Example: print(obj1) will print: CustomClass with value: 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. __add__ method:\n",
        "\n",
        "The __add__ method is used to define how two objects of the class are added together using the + operator.\n",
        "In this case, we check if the other operand is also an instance of CustomClass, and if so, we add their value attributes and return a new instance of CustomClass with the sum.\n",
        "If the other operand is not an instance of CustomClass, a TypeError is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage Example: obj1 + obj2 calls __add__, which adds the values of obj1 and obj2 and returns a new CustomClass object with the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "What These Methods Allow You to Do:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. __str__: This method allows you to control how an instance of your class is converted into a string. This is useful for debugging, logging, or providing a user-friendly string representation of your objects when printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. __add__: This method allows you to define custom behavior for the + operator. In this case, adding two objects of the class together results in a new object where the values of the two original objects are summed. This is helpful when you want objects of your class to support arithmetic or logical operations."

        "The problem arises when class D inherits from both B and C, and both B and C have inherited from class A. If class A defines a method, and both B and C override that method, the question becomes: Which version of the method should class D inherit?\n",

        "For the example above, since B overrides the method of A, the method from B will be called. If class B had not defined method, Python would have moved to class C, and if not found there, it would have called A.\n",

        "Why Python’s Approach Works:\n",
