        "###Q1 Discuss string slicing and provide examples.\n",
        "Ans: String slicing is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to access a subset of a string. Slicing can be used to extract portions of a string based on specified indices. The syntax for slicing is as follows:\n",
        "string[start:end:step]\n",
        "\n",
        "start: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).\n",
        "\n",
        "end: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).\n",
        "\n",
        "step: The amount by which the index increases. This parameter is optional; the default step is 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "*KEYPOINTS*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Indices in Python are zero-based, meaning the first character of a string is at index 0.\n",
        "2. Negative indices can be used to slice from the end of the string. For example, -1 refers to the last character, -2 to the second-to-last, and so forth.\n",
        "3. If any of the parameters are omitted, Python will assume default values:\n",
        "(a) Omitting start means it starts from the beginning of the string.\n",
        "(b) Omitting end means it goes until the end of the string.\n",
        "(c) Omitting step means it defaults to 1.\n",

        "###Q2  Explain the key features of lists in Python.\n",
        "Ans: Lists are one of the fundamental data structures in Python, providing a versatile way to store collections of items.\n",
        "Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
        "1. Ordered Collection\n",
        "Lists maintain the order of elements. This means that items are stored in the sequence they are added, and you can access them by their index.\n",
        "2. Mutable\n",
        "Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after their creation. You can add, remove, or change elements within a list.\n",
        "3. Dynamic Size\n",
        "The size of a list can change dynamically. You can append new elements to a list, and it will automatically allocate more memory as needed.\n",
        "4. Heterogeneous Elements\n",
        "Lists can contain elements of different data types. For example, you can have integers, strings, floats, and even other lists within a single list.\n",
        "5. Indexing and Slicing\n",
        "You can access elements in a list using indexing (e.g., my_list[0] for the first element) and slicing (e.g., my_list[1:3] to get a sublist of elements).\n",
        "6. Support for Nested Lists\n",
        "Lists can contain other lists as elements, allowing for the creation of complex data structures like matrices or multidimensional arrays.\n",
        "7. Common Methods\n",
        "Python lists come with a variety of built-in methods, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "insert(): Inserts an element at a specified index.\n",
        "\n",
        "remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.\n",
        "\n",
        "pop(): Removes and returns an element at a given index (default is the last item).\n",
        "\n",
        "sort(): Sorts the elements of the list in place.\n",
        "\n",
        "reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in the list.\n",
        "8. List Comprehensions\n",
        "Python provides a concise way to create lists using list comprehensions, which allow for generating lists based on existing lists or other iterables in a single line of code. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]  # Creates a list of squares from 0 to 9\n",
        "9. Iteration\n",
        "Lists can be easily iterated over using loops, such as for loops, allowing you to access each element in sequence.\n",
        "10. Support for Membership Testing\n",
        "You can check if an item exists in a list using the in keyword, which is very useful for membership testing."

        "\n",
        "--> List: Items can be added, removed, or changed.\n",

        "--> Tuple: Items cannot be changed once the tuple is created.\n",
        "4. *PERFORMANCE*\n",
        "\n",
        "--> List: Generally slower than tuples for certain operations due to their mutability.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Tuple: Faster than lists for operations that involve iteration or access, due to their immutability.\n",

        "--> List: Ideal for collections of items that may need to change, such as maintaining a dynamic list of tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Tuple: Suitable for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or RGB color values.\n",
        "6. *METHODS*\n",

        "--> List: Has many built-in methods, including append(), remove(), pop(), sort(), etc.\n",

        "###*Key Features of Sets*\n",
        "1. Uniqueness:\n",
        "\n",
        "Each element in a set is unique; duplicates are not allowed. If an attempt is made to add a duplicate element, it will be ignored.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In a set of integers {1, 2, 3, 2}, the set will only contain {1, 2, 3}.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Unordered:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets do not maintain any particular order for their elements. The order in which elements are added does not matter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: The set {3, 1, 2} is considered the same as {1, 2, 3}.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Mutability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets can be mutable or immutable depending on the programming language. In languages like Python, a set is mutable, while an frozenset is immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: We can create a mutable set: s = {1, 2, 3} and then modify it with s.add(4), resulting in {1, 2, 3, 4}. An immutable version would be fs = frozenset(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets support various mathematical operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "(A) Union:\n",

        "(B) Intersection:\n",

        " Returns elements common to both sets.\n",

        "\n",
        "Elements in one set but not in the other.\n",

        "Sets provide efficient membership testing, allowing for fast checks to see if an element exists within the set.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Data Management:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets are useful for storing collections of items where duplicates are not allowed, such as a list of registered users or unique tags in a blog.\n",
        "Example: A user may have a set of favorite genres: {\"fiction\", \"science\", \"history\"}.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Mathematical Operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "In mathematical computations, sets are employed for operations like finding common elements in datasets.\n",
        "Example: In a class project, students can use sets to find common topics between two different research groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Database Operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets are often used in database queries, such as when finding unique values in a column.\n",
        "Example: Selecting distinct cities from a database: SELECT DISTINCT city FROM locations;\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Graph Theory:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets can represent vertices or edges in graph structures, aiding in various algorithms.\n",
        "Example: In a network of friends, a set can represent unique friends: {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"}.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Computer Science Applications:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets are utilized in algorithms for tasks like deduplication, pattern recognition, and clustering.\n",

        "* Why It Matters: A dictionary uses a hash table to manage key-value pairs. When you add a key to a dictionary, Python computes its hash value and stores the key-value pair in a specific location in memory. If a mutable object were allowed as a key, and that object changed, its hash value could also change. This would disrupt the integrity of the dictionary, making it impossible to retrieve the associated value.\n",

        "* Accessing Keys: When you retrieve a value from a dictionary using a key, Python relies on the hash of that key to find the correct location in memory. If the key were mutable and changed after being used, the dictionary would not be able to locate the original key's value, leading to inconsistent behavior.\n",
